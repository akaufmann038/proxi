In order for the app to work, you need the server and app running at the same time.

## REST API

To get this to run, shell into the API directory and execute (you'd also need npm installed but that's easy to google):

npm install

npm start

## React Native

To get this to run, shell into React Native (cd React\ Native) and execute:

npm install

npm start

You will need xcode or the Expo Go app to run the app. If you have xcode, just open up an IOS simulator (make sure this is open first before you run the react native app). When you run the app, hit i in your terminal to open it up in the simulator.
